# HANGMAN

## How to play:

The classic game of hangman is a simple one. One has to guess a word by choosing letters that might be in the word. If the letter is in the word , then the letter/letters at their respective positions are revealed and the game continues, however if you guess a letter that is not in the word , there are consequences: a little man representing your "lives" in the game inches one step closer to his grim fate. The game continues until all the letters in the word are guessed, resulting in a victory, the other outcome is that the player runs out of lives, resulting in a loss .
